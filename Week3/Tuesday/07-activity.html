        <!-- Make a new html page, make a script tag

        Make a variable called shirt_cost and set it to 3.5 
        
        Make another variable called tax_rate and set it to 0.1
        
        Prompt the user: How many shirts do you want to buy? And store it into a variable named quant_shirts_to_buy
        
        Then make a variable called cost_pre_tax and set it quant_shirts_to_buy * shirt_cost
        
        Then make a variable called cost_post_tax and set it to cost_pre_tax + cost_pre_tax*tax_rate
        
        Then alert cost_post_tax and say you owe this much:  -->

    <script>
        var shirt_cost = 3.5;
        var tax_rate = 0.1;
        var quant_shirts_to_buy = prompt('How many shirts do you want to buy?');

        var cost_pre_tax = parseInt(quant_shirts_to_buy)*shirt_cost;
        var cost_post_tax = cost_pre_tax*(1+tax_rate);

        alert(`Your total is: $${cost_post_tax}`);
