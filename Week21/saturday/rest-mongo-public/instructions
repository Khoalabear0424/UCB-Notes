use mongo for this
make an express api that has the following routes

a database named frogs_db

a collection named frogs

a get route that gets you all documents from the frogs collection

a get route that gets you one frog by its _id

a post route that inserts a frog document with following information: name, species

a put route that updates a frog's name and species by its _id

a delete route that deletes a frog by its _id

please write curl calls to test each route

note: you do not have to go into the mongo console for this - mongo will automatically do everything for you including making the database

you can however go into check if everything worked the way you thought

hint: you can look at the code i sent out going over this on thursday
