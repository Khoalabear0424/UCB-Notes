-- looking into partitions and lag could help with this version of problem 1
-- List the difference between an order amount and the previous order amount for that particular employee
	
	-- and you'd start off with this:

		SELECT *
		FROM shipments
		LEFT JOIN orders
		ON shipments.order_id = orders.id
		WHERE employee_id = 95
		ORDER BY employee_id;
