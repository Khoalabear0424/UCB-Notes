what is MySQL

	it's a program

		like Microsoft Word

	you need to have a program running to be able to use it 

		you double click on Microsoft Word to use it

			Microsoft Word runs on a port on your computer

				for ports on your computer, you can only have one program running on it at a time

		for MySQL you run it from the terminal (mac, linux) or on windows, you double click on the mysql.exe file or you double click on MAMP and click start servers

	but what kind of program is it?

		it's a database

			and what's a database

				it's a program that let's you store data and retrieve data

				we used one already, 
					firebase 

	why should we use MySQL

		it's structured

			because of that structure, you can do very complex queries in a few lines of code

	compare MySQL to Firebase to the fs package

		when should we use the fs package?

			making a csv 
				name,email
				haven,haven@haven.com
				juthika,juthika@juthika.com

			make a json file 

			make a log file 
				you console log a lot of stuff

					instead of console logging, what you can do is write to a file called node.txt

		when should we use firebase?

			when we don't need any reporting

			your budget is 0

			you're working on a mobile app and you're trying to keep costs low

			something realtime 

			only care about the frontend experience

		when should you use MySQL

			when you care about reporting

			when there are clear relationships in your data

				let's say you have users that sign up to your website

				and you have posts that they can make

				you need to associate the users to the posts 


when you delete a record in MySQL

	does everything shift up?

		In excel that's the case

		in MySQL that's not the case

			so once you give an id to a record in a MySQL table, that's the id for life
