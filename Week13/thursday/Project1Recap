Project 1 Recap:

Things that Went Well:
1. The app worked as intended and it looked good!
2. No fighting amongst teammates
3. Learned google maps api!

Things that couldve gone better:
1. Starting out with too many features that couldnt be completed
2. Using github was difficult at first, merging and pushing etc.

ANything TA and teacher could do better:
1. Stress that teams shouldnt try to put too many features at the beginning!
