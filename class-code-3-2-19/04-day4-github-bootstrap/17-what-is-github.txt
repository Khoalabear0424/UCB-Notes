what is github

	github is a place where you can store your code

	the code goes into "folders"

		these folders are called repositories

		the folders themselves have urls

			they can be public

			or private

	what are the benefits of using github

		1. your code is backed up

			with github you can take snapshots of your code
				these snapshots are called commits

					you can go back to a very particular point of your code - if you need to

		2. you can work with other developers

			if you override someone's code by accident, github will alert you

				this alert is called a conflict

		3. it's a great place to find code and show what you've been working on

there's software called git

	git is what creates those commits


	github is a site that stores repositories
		it also let's you set who can access those folders

	analogy

		git is like microsoft word

			you can make .doc files


		github is like google drive

			you can store the .doc files on it
