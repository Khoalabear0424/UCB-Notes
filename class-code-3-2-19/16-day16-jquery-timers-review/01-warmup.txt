1. write a function that takes a number and returns an array of numbers up to that number

	for example

	1 should return [1]

	5 should return [1,2,3,4,5]

2. write a function that takes a number and determines whether it is prime or not
	
	prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by 1 and 5 without a remainder. Any other number will give a remainder

	5 is prime because it can only be divided by 1 and 5 without a remainder. 

		2,3,4 all divide with 5 but have a remainder.

	4 is not prime because 1,2 and 4 divide into it without a remainder.

3. write a function that takes a number and returns an array of the fibonacci numbers up to that number
	
	the fibonacci sequence is as followed
		1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....

	your function should work for the number 50 or 100 or 200, etc.
