Why node and why backend?
	
	node.js

		so many JS developers that just were front end developers

			then node.js came out 

			and they were suddenly back end developers

		it's easy to create an API 
			OMDB api

		it's kind of easy to do real time stuff

		it has a huge community of people making things and giving them away for free

			open source

	backend code

		can read and write and append to files

		can connect to a database directly 

			MySQL

			PostgreSQL

			MongoDB

			CouchDB

			Oracle

				because super complex queries are 3 to 4 lines of code - whereas in firebase - it's a weekend of work

		you can style the url in anyway you want

			app.get('/:animal', function(req, res){
				db.get('animals where name = ', [animalName])
			});

			

		YOU CAN'T DO THESE THINGS WITH FRONT END CODE
