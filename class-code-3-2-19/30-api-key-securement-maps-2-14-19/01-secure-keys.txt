how to secure api keys
	
	1. make a js file

	var apiKey = "sdkjfsjdkfjdf"

	2. include that js file in your html file above where you're using the api key

	3. make a .gitignore file 

		put the name of the js file from step one here

	some people have to put the api key in the script tag itself

		var s = $('<script>').attr('src', 'urlGoesHere' + apiKey);
		$('body').append(s);
