make a node app that creates pet objects with 3 characteristics

    name

    typ
        this would be a cat, dog, mouse

    trick
        this would be
            fetch

each pet should look something like this:

    {
        name: 'fido',
        typ: 'dog',
        trick: 'fetch'
    }

your program should store many pets into an array called pets

Bonus: store the array of pets into a file, so that any pets made are saved and retrieved and set to the pets variable
