// make your own constructor function to create objects

// make a Pokemon constructor function that makes an object 

// 	with 3 keys in it
//    		name, hp, attacks 
	// name is a string

	// hp is a number

	// attacks is an array of attacks

add an attack function to the prototype of the pokemon constructor function that chooses a random attack from the pokemon's attacks property and will console log it

// use the Pokemon constructor function to create 3 pokemon objects

// console log each object

//call attack on each of the objects

//for one of the objects give it an additional property of friendly = true
