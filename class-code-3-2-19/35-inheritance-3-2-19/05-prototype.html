		//Array is a constructor function built into JavaScript that you can use to create arrays
		// var a = new Array();


	//everything in JavaScript is ultimately created with constructor functions and all constructor functions have a __proto__ property that points to a special object called the Prototype


	function Animal(n, s, hf, cs, cf){

		this.species = s;
		this.hasFur = hf;

				console.log('Swimming!');
			}else{
				console.log('can not swim!')
			}
		}

	var r = new Animal('rhino', 'extangenero', false, true, false);

	// if I do r.swim() it'll trigger but swim isn't directly in the r object, it's in the prototype of the r object

	//what's the point of the prototype, why would we ever use it?	

		// so you can use constructor functions to make many similar objects

		// so if you have functions that you want to add into the objects that you're creating, you can save memory by putting those functions into the Constructor's prototype


		// 	all objects created with a constructor function 

		// 		share the same exact prototype object
