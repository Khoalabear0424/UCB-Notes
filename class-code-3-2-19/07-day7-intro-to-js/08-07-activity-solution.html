	Make a new html page, make a script tag

	Make a variable called shirt_cost and set it to 3.5 

	Make another variable called tax_rate and set it to 0.1

	Prompt the user: How many shirts do you want to buy? And store it into a variable named quant_shirts_to_buy

	Then make a variable called cost_pre_tax and set it quant_shirts_to_buy * shirt_cost

	Then make a variable called cost_post_tax and set it to cost_pre_tax + cost_pre_tax*tax_rate

	Then alert cost_post_tax and say you owe this much: 
<script type="text/javascript">
	var tax_rate = 0.1;
	var shirt_cost = 3.5;

	//the value of any prompt is a string always

		//one way
			var quant_shirts_to_buy = prompt('How many shirts do you want to buy?');

		//another way
			var quant_shirts_to_buy = parseInt(prompt('How many shirts do you want to buy?'));

		//another way
			var quant_shirts_to_buy = prompt('How many shirts do you want to buy?');

			quant_shirts_to_buy = parseInt(quant_shirts_to_buy);


	var cost_pre_tax = quant_shirts_to_buy * shirt_cost;
	var cost_post_tax = cost_pre_tax + cost_pre_tax*tax_rate;

	//one way
		alert(`Your total cost is ${cost_post_tax}`);

	//another way
		alert(cost_post_tax);

	//another way
		alert("Your total cost is " + cost_post_tax);
