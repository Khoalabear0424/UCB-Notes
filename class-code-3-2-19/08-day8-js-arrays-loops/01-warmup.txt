1. make a variable named bearType and set it to 'brown'

2. on the next line make another variable and prompt the user to guess a bear type

3. write code so if the user typed in the same bear type as you, it'll alert "you guessed it!"

if the user types in penguin then alert "that's not a bear type!"

if the user types in anything else then alert "haven't heard that one before"

4. update the bearType variable to 'polar'
