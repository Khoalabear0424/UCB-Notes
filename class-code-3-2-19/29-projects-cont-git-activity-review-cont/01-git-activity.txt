with a group of two or more

	1. choose one person in the group to make a repo

	2. add the other people in your group as collaborators in the settings of the repository

		check off make a README on creation

	3. have everyone clone the repo

	4. each person should do this

		1. create a branch off of the master branch with your name as the branch name

		2. put your name in the README file 

		3. add and commit this 

		4. push up to your branch

		5. make a pull request to the master branch

		6. assign someone in your group to look over your pull request

	5. you'll encounter merge conflicts, fix the merge conflict by doing 

		git pull origin master 

		fixing the readme file 

		committing this 

		pushing it up to your branch

		then clicking merge

	6. for practice, pull down everyone's branches in your group

		git fetch

		git checkout <branchNameGoesHere>

	7. after everyone is done merging their branches, delete all the branches, EXCEPT master

		use these cmds to do this

			delete a local branch (lives on your computer)
				$ git branch -d <branch> # Shorter version

			delete a remote branch (lives on github)
				$ git branch -dr orgin/<branch> # Shorter
